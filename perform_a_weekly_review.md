# Perform An Inventory Review AKA Weekly Review

With this recipe, you'll learn how to regularly comb through your items and keep everything current.

## Step 1: Search For Things That Haven't Been Seen In A While

Run a search like this

    last_seen:<now-1w

And click the eye for each result to mark them as seen. You may opt to exclude certain things depending on your system, like things tagged "archive" that you want to keep but don't need to see in your review.

## Step 2: Find Things With Few Tags

Run a search like this

    tag_count:<3

and expand on the tags to make finding things easier.

## Step 3: Do A Brain Dump

Having reviewed everything that's in MindAUX, now is a good time to create the things that aren't.

In the search box, you can do things like this to help ease entry:

    ;; call bob
    ;; clean desk
    ;; call IRS #important
    ;; buy a new heater
    ;; call mom %(+: @ tomorrow)
