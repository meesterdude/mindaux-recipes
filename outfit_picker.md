# Outfit Picker

In this recipe, we'll be building up an outfit database to help us pick what to wear.

For this, you'll need to create many items, such as taking a selfie everyday or using the collection you already have. Each item will represent one "outfit" and include data to help us find it better. For every item you create, you'll want to identify what articles of clothing are in it, and add any tags.

an example item might have metadata that looks like this:
    shoes: brown cowboy
    pants: classic blue jeans
    shirt: button up white

If you have a lot of clothes (or just want to go the extra mile) you can assign each article of clothing its own identifier and mark it in sharpie on the label; or even better, give them their own item in MindAUX and reference the short_id. this reduces room for error when populating items, and makes it easier to purges clothes you've thrown out.

You should also tag items with as much as is relevant with not only the picture but it's contents, location, season, time, mood, color, and so on.

With enough entries, you'll have a large pool to sample from and can easily figure out what outfits will work for your given sitch.
